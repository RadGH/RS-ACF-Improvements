# RS ACF Improvements (WordPress Plugin)

This plugin adds a link to edit field groups on user profiles and 
taxonomy term pages. This behavior is similar to the post edit link 
that appears on the admin bar when viewing a post.

(Because for some reason ACF never added equivalent links for field 
groups on user profiles or term pages.)
